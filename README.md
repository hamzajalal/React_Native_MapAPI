# React_Native_MapAPI
Basics of React Native with the use of Navigation, background image and Map API


This repository contains a React Native project, implementing the react-native mapsÂ package.

### Versions:
React-Native: 16.0.0

Shoutem/ui: 0.22.0

React-Native Maps: 0.18.3

React-native-vector-icons: 4.4.2

React-navigation: 1.0.0

## Installation
I have used React Native guide to install react native environment by the command below:

npm install -g create-react-native-app

Then I have run the following command to create a new React Native project called "MyProject":

create-react-native-app MyProject

Then I have installed CocoaPods and React-Native-Maps in my project from guide and downloaded the map library from npm:

npm install react-native-maps --save

I have started the project by creating 2 different pages: one for login and one for home screen. Then I have used background images to see how the basic things works in React Native. To connect these pages I have installed the react-navigation and understood the concept of it and how it works.

Note: This was the learning project to see how react native works and how to play with navigation and Map api to understand the basics of it.
